h2. Children's Future International

"Children's Future International":http://www.childrensfutureinternational.org/ is a charity in Cambodia that cares for vulnerable children and provides food, shelter, education, protection and a sense of community.

One of the greatest challenges for the charity is keeping track of the children: where they are, who they live with, what support they need and are receiving. "Eden Development":http://edendevelopment.co.uk/ have begun making this web application to help solve these problems.

This project is open source, we welcome user contributions, and we are happy for other organisations to make use of the code.

The project tracker is available at "http://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/54322":http://www.pivotaltracker.com/projects/54322
